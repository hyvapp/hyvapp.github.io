    <div class="heading">Hyv FAQ's</div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">What is Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">It’s an online platform where you share content with your friends, filtered through common interests.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">How can I join Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">The app can be downloaded from the play store or the app store. To register, you just
        need your phone number. Simple.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">Who can join Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">You, your friends, your family, your coworkers, anyone and everyone with a smart phone.
        (Do note that you can only ask your phone book contacts to join your Hyvs. So dig in that
        contact book right away!)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">What is ‘a’ Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">A Hyv is an interest group on the app. Like, science or health or arts. Each is made up of
        the people from your phone contact book who share similar tastes.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">What interests can I select?</div>
      <div class="desc">We worked hard to slim it down to comprehensive topics to start with. And we’ll keep
        adding more in coming times.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">Why did we create the Hyv app?</div>
      <div class="desc">In a world of noise and half-hearted connections that social media calls friends, we
        realised that the digital world is making reading content we like tougher and tougher.
        Plus, it doesn&#39;t help when even the best and intelligent analytics engines fail in
        understanding what people like and want.
        So we decided to keep it simple, exclusive and tight: share relevant content with relevant
        people.
        This way you stay connected for content with your friends without the noise and strangers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">So how does it work?</div>
      <div class="desc">Once you register on the app, you get to choose your interests or Hyvs. These small
        groups are populated with other people who have also registered on the app, but they are
        on your phone contact book.
        To share, all you need to do is choose content you like from any source. The app filters it
        to the relevant Hyvs.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">How many interests can I sign up for?</div>
      <div class="desc">There is no limit to the interests you can choose. Or the friends from your contact book
        who can join your Hyv.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">How can I join a Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">You could choose according to you liking from the list you are presented. You are also
        shown the people from your contact book who have the Hyv app. Only these people can
        share content with you.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">How do I block someone from my Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">You can choose to block or unblock anyone, at anytime. Who you choose to block, is only
        known to you and the other person does not see who has blocked them.
        Go to MY HYV and click to see the people in your contact book who have the Hyv app.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">How can I create a new Hyv?</div>
      <div class="desc">You can’t customise an interest, but really join one from the list available to you.
        Additionally, you can spread the word about your Hyv by sharing the app link from the
        ‘Post on social’ section to get friends on board. Do give us feedback if we are missing an
        interest group you feel strongly about.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">Can strangers find me on the Hyv app?</div>
      <div class="desc">Only people from your phone contact book can see you in a Hyv. This isn&#39;t a discovery app
        but one that encourages you to build better relationships with people you already know
        through the content flow between you. It’s a platform for likeminded people. Here no one is
        a stranger.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">Will I get spam on the app?</div>
      <div class="desc">We don’t allow any sales promotions on the app. Nor do we share your information with
        anyone. The contest is curated by you and your friends. We are only the facilitators.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
      <div class="title">How to you use Hyv to share content?</div>
      <div class="desc">Ah, this is where things get stupidly simple. You can share from any platform with our Hyv button. The app will read the content and
        filter it to the appropriate Hyv. Without bothering you at all.
        Similarly to read the content shared by your friends you just open the app and browse
        through the feed.
        Additionally, we have options to bookmark or reshare the content on the app as well.
        And if you’d like to delete something you shared, just hop across to ‘Manage my Shares’
        and delete.</div>
